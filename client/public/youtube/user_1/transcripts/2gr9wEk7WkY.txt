You obviously didn't know as a kid that you would be worth 10 million dollars one day. I knew for a fact. You knew for a fact. I knew for a fact. Unequivocally. So how much money do you make in a day? Just like 10, 11,000 per day, every single day. Meet the new generation of ultra-rich YouTubers. These 20-something year olds claim to be self-made multi-millionaires, claiming they all made it because of their online businesses. But how much of that is actually true? How do they really make their money? Or simply put, are they just straight up lying and scamming their audiences with their bullshit products and courses? Let's find out. Let's start off with our first guy, Iman Ghazi. 22 years old, grew up in a low-income family in London, divorced parents and lives in Dubai currently. Works out, smokes cigars, likes to party. Super cool. But what did Iman Ghazi do to acquire this much wealth at such a young age? Now, the first habit that made me a multi-millionaire by the age of 21 is reading. You have to read books. To me, that's a non-negotiable. The first millionaire skill that you need to learn, and this one might really, really shock you, is stop watching the news. The next millionaire skill will save you a lot of money and also really increase the quality of your life along the way. And that's actually getting a really good tailor. Wow, what a great start. You know what? Let's come back to Iman to see what the f**k he's actually doing to become so rich next to reading, getting his suits tailored, and not watching the news. Let's first see if this next guy can give us a bit more clarity on how they got rich so young. I'm not supposed to make fun of his name. My own last name is probably more difficult to pronounce. Anyways, Sebastian Giorgio, 23 years old, grew up in a low-income family in Detroit. Parents got divorced. I see a trend here. Drives expensive cars, is building out his dream house, net worth of 8 million dollars. And look at that, hangs out with Iman Gazi, Seb Giorgio. Interesting. Coincidence or are they part of some kind of secret evil scamming mastermind? Let's find out. What does Sebastian actually do? This is my story from $1,000 to 8 million in like six years or something. So I watched a lot of his podcast appearances, must have gone through dozens of his videos, including his older videos from five years ago. It is Sebastian here and today I have something extremely, extremely special for you guys. And to me, it seems like at first, Sebastian wanted to lift himself and his family out of poverty by becoming a neurosurgeon. He figured that's a well-paid job. He made a plan how to get there and started working to save up money. But after a couple of years of working at Taco Bells and the car wash, Sebastian stumbled across this YouTuber called Graham Stephan. Stephan. I don't know how to pronounce his name. I'm called Stephan. I don't know how to pronounce his fucking name. Another well-established, ultra-rich YouTuber that has earned his stripes on YouTube through the real estate game. Once Sebastian found out how much you can make through real estate, he tried to make big bucks as a realtor himself. But it wasn't until Sebastian asked the great search engine of the internet how to make money online that he went down the rabbit hole of dropshipping. I quit real estate and went full-time into dropshipping. He soon started his first dropshipping stores that made exactly zero dollars. But a couple of fails later, however, Sebastian got his first taste of success. Dropshipping is doing well. I remember like my first $400 a day. Now, parallel to his growing dropshipping business, he documented his whole journey on YouTube, sharing dropshipping advice with his audience. And after a couple of videos, his YouTube channel started popping off, earning him even some more money. Soon, he made a course about dropshipping, sharing his knowledge and experience with his audience, making even more money. You could say things are going well for Sebastian. That is, until his girlfriend broke up with him, until he was out of shape and he quit his YouTube channel. He went through a rut. But like all hero journeys, he came out stronger than ever, started his new business, a Google AdSense agency, making tens of thousands of dollars per day. He picked up his YouTube channel again and started making more money. He put some of his extra money he was earning into crypto and flipping NFTs. My friend got me into NFTs. I started flipping NFTs. I started trading NFTs. Growing his net worth to eight million dollars. I don't know. There's nothing really strange about his story. I mean, from the podcasts I've seen with him, he seems like a pretty down-to-earth guy. He's Christian. He wants to have a lot of kids. He doesn't drink. I don't play video games. I don't really drink. So, this one might actually be speaking the truth. I mean, he's documented exactly how he has achieved all his success, from dropshipping to a Google AdSense agency. Unlike Himangazi, who has made 25 million dollars by reading. Before I get back to him, I want to investigate this new kid on the block, who came out of nowhere and has exploded on the YouTube finance scene. I'm talking about Jordan Welch. Grew up in Florida in a single-parent household. Nice cars. Hangs out with Wiz Khalifa and billionaire Kevin O'Leary and Himangazi. Claims to have 2.5 million in 2021. But how does he get his money? Let's take a look at all his businesses he claims made him a multi-millionaire. Business number one, Shopify store. So, my first stream of income and my primary focus is my Shopify brand. You can see that my Shopify store has done around $3,300 in sales and over $113,000 this month in revenue. This store actually started out as a dropshipping store, but over the... Okay, you started with dropshipping as well. Business number two, his YouTube channel. So, as you can see, in the last 30 days of my YouTube channel, I brought in around $13,700 in revenue, which is pretty much 100% profit. Okay, so it seems like he might not be an overnight success as his videos date back to 2015 when he got his first camera for Christmas. So, he's been making videos since he was a young kid. I know we haven't made a video in about three months. Took a break and then came back to YouTube in January 2021 and he made a quarter million dollars through AdSense in 2021. Not bad, almost as good as my channel. Business number three, affiliate marketing and sponsorships. In total, from affiliate marketing, I made around $75,000 this year. 75K. And business number four is his own software company called ViralFold, which has brought Jordan $600,000 in profit in 2021. Basically, it's the all-in-one toolkit for anybody looking to start their own online store. Okay, so it seems like this is Jordan Welch's big cash cow. Let's see what this business is actually about and what the internet has to say about this product. ViralFold, the all-in-one toolkit for building your first profitable Shopify store. Daily trending products, custom video ads, optimized product pages, personal coaching from Jordan and his team. Okay, let's see what the reviews have to say about this business. Pros, a three-day free trial. Jordan Welch is an established and successful dropship. It's a bit pricey. ViralFold has a 2.5 star rating on Trustpilot. However, there are multiple success stories. ViralFold review. Is ViralFold worth it or is it a scam? ViralFold isn't a scam. You get access to the software's dashboard if you pay for a monthly subscription. If you're looking for software to help streamline your dropshipping business and scale faster, ViralFold might be worth it. I mean, going through the reviews, it seems to me like the biggest cons are that it's pricey, plus the knowledge shared in ViralFold is available for free on the internet. But I guess, I mean, that's the case with all online courses and dropshipping. But I guess, I mean, that's the case with all online courses and products, right? You can find everything yourself for free on the internet, but it takes you time. You have to filter out all the bullshit and search everything for yourself. And when you have a course or a product like ViralFold, it consolidates all the valuable information. So there's mixed reviews, but all in all, it's not a scam. It might just be a product that needs more improvement. I honestly don't get it. Both Sebastian Georgiou and Jordan Welch seem like pretty down-to-earth guys that just saw opportunities, worked hard, and achieved the success they want. It seems like their apparent overnight success was actually 5, 6, 7 years in the making. Could it just be that Jordan Welch and Sebastian Georgiou learned everything they know through the internet? Instead of watching TikToks and playing video games, they watched tutorials, read books, took courses, and then applied everything they learned. Could it be they failed repeatedly, but tried again until they became successful? No, it can't be. He must be lying. What am I missing? There's got to be something. Of course. You know something like the Good Life Eatery? That's like 15 pounds. I can't pay 15 pounds for that. So now what I want to do is I want to take this. I want to share my journey. This millionaire documented his entire life since he was broke. You end up feeling quite lonely from that, and it's something I had to deal with for quite a while. I've gone to the gym, meditated, read. I actually have to get to packing. Just ran a couple more ads for some clients. This dude literally documented his whole journey. I made 5,000, I don't know if you can see that, 5,100 pounds after tax. 2018. I just remember just instances where I just felt so helpless. 2019. For the next two months in Bali. 70-80% of our clients are in the info product space. 2020. This deal is 2,500 pounds a month. 2021. I'm honestly so excited to go visit Nepal with the team, bring the team out to Nepal, and just look at all the incredible work that we've done. This guy has his own school in Nepal. Yeah, of course, why not? I don't know, man. You know, in a sense, this guy and all these other rich YouTubers have more credibility than, I don't know, a Warren Buffett, for example. They documented every single step of their journey on their YouTube channel. If you don't believe them, if you think they're a scam, if you think they're a fraud, it's all here. You know what it is with these guys? The title of this video is called The Dark Truth. But the dark truth is not that these guys are scammers, liars, or big frauds. The dark truth is that these guys, when they were 15, 16, saw opportunities, worked their ass off, and achieved success at a very young age. While the majority of people went out partying, having fun, drinking, playing video games, and are now placing hateful comments as a way of coping for their wasted potential and frustration. I mean, come on, 25 million at 22. Who are you kidding, man? Stop, don't be that guy, man. It's really simple. In life, you can be either of the following two. You can be the guy that has figured out that the educational system and the standard 9 to 5 life is outdated. It's no longer the safest path in life, nor is it the most potentially successful path in life either. You're the guy that learned that the internet has brought an infinite amount of new opportunities. And if you use the internet wisely, you can become very successful at a very young age. Or you can be this guy, a person that doesn't use the internet wisely. I know for myself that I'm the type of guy that actually feels inspired by these young successful kids and now want to make something out of my own life. Even though they have a 10-year head start on me and I made a lot of wrong decisions by going through the whole corporate office and 9 to 5 life first, I'm now completely changing my life and turning everything around. And I'm sharing every single lesson on this journey on my YouTube channel. Now, if that's something you might find interesting, then definitely stick around. And I want to leave you with one question. Would you rather be the guy doing the hating or would you rather be the guy being hated on? Cheers!
